# Quantum Circuit Diagrams - Adobe Illustrator

During my studies in Quantum information science I had a need to draw quantum circuit diagrams. There are many tools 
offered in LaTeX and Qiskit, but I often wanted more flexibility for my figures. I haven't found any templates for 
quantum circuits for Adobe Illustrator (which I prefer to work in), hence I want to share my templates.

The repo contains Adobe Illustrator file with some building blocks for quantum circuit diagrams.

Basic elements were designed as `symbols` ([see tutorial](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/symbols.html)). 
This means one can modify a symbol and it will change all the objects linked to the symbol (e.g. change the font for 
all the objects). Symbol approach also ensures proper scaling of the object for two-qubit gates.

Feel free to ask questions or add your examples/corrections through a merge request.
